Firefly III is a tool to help you manage your finances. Please read the full description [in the wiki](https://github.com/JC5/firefly-iii/wiki/full-description).

Firefly Mark III is a new version of Firefly built upon best practices and lessons learned
from building [Firefly](https://github.com/JC5/Firefly). It's Mark III since the original Firefly never made it outside of my
laptop and [Firefly II](https://github.com/JC5/Firefly) is live.

## Current features

- [A double-entry bookkeeping system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-entry_bookkeeping_system);
- You can store, edit and remove withdrawals, deposits and transfers. This allows you full financial management;
- It's possible to create, change and manage money using _budgets_;
- Organize transactions using categories;
- Save towards a goal using piggy banks;
- Predict and anticipate large expenses using "repeated expenses" (ie. yearly taxes);
- Predict and anticipate bills using "recurring transactions" (rent for example);
- View basic income / expense reports.
- Lots of help text in case you don't get it;

Everything is organised:

- Clear views that should show you how you're doing;
- Easy navigation through your records;
- Browse back and forth to see previous months or even years;
- Lots of charts because we all love them.
- Financial reporting showing you how well you are doing;

## Changes

Firefly III will feature, but does not feature yet:


- More control over other resources outside of personal finance
  - Accounts shared with a partner (household accounts)
  - Debts
  - Credit cards
- More test-coverage;
- Firefly will be able to split transactions; a single purchase can be split in multiple entries, for more fine-grained control.
- Firefly will be able to join transactions.
- Any other features I might not have thought of.

Some stuff has been removed:

- The nesting of budgets, categories and beneficiaries is removed because it was pretty pointless.
- Firefly will not encrypt the content of the (MySQL) tables. Old versions of Firefly had this capability but it sucks when searching, sorting and organizing entries.

## Current state
I have the basics up and running. Test coverage is currently coming, slowly.

Although I have not checked extensively, some forms and views have CSRF vulnerabilities. This is because not all
views escape all characters by default. Will be fixed.
